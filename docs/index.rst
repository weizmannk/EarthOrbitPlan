EarthOrbitPlan: An Educational Framework for Multimessenger Observing Scenarios
===============================================================================

EarthOrbitPlan is an educational framework that introduces students and researchers to an end-to-end workflow for simulating compact binary coalescences (:term:`CBC`),
from the  detection of gravitational-wave events by the `International Gravitational-wave Network <https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/>`_ (:term:`IGWN`) to the preparation
of electromagnetic follow-up observation plans using the :math:`\mathrm{M^4OPT}` toolkit. These follow-up campaigns span a wide range of facilities,
from Far-UV instruments such as UVEX, to Near-UV missions like UVEX and ULTRASAT, and optical surveys including ZTF and Rubin.

A Tool for GW Multi-messenger Follow-up and Observational Impact Analysis EarthOrbitPlan is a pipeline designed to support the follow-up of gravitational wave (GW) events using multiple observatories, both ground-based and in orbit. The tool utilizes M4OPT to determine the optimal sky regions accessible to each telescope (Field of Regard, FoR), calculate the required exposure time to achieve the desired signal-to-noise ratio, and identify the most probable sky coordinates for observation.  The pipeline automates key processes, including event processing, filtering, statistical analysis, and visualization of observational data. It simulates different follow-up scenarios for Binary Neutron Star (BNS), Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH), and Binary Black Hole (BBH) events, enabling researchers to evaluate the impact of various telescopes on multimessenger observation campaigns.  This approach provides a robust framework for optimizing observation strategies and enhancing the scientific return of GW multimessenger follow-up efforts.



# EarthOrbitPlan: An Educational Framework for Multimessenger Observing Scenarios

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/EarthOrbitPlan/badge/?version=latest)](https://EarthOrbitPlan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**EarthOrbitPlan** is an open-source educational framework designed to introduce students, educators, and early-career researchers to the challenges and opportunities of gravitational wave (GW) multi-messenger follow-up observations.
By simulating realistic observing scenarios, from the initial detection of a GW event to the coordinated search for its electromagnetic counterpart. EarthOrbitPlan offers a hands-on approach to learning about the coordination and optimization required for modern astronomy.


## Key Features

- **Educational Focus:** Tutorials, example notebooks, and documentation tailored for teaching multi-messenger astronomy, observation scheduling, and data analysis.
- **Realistic Simulations:** Recreates GW follow-up campaigns for various event types (BNS, NSBH, BBH) using state-of-the-art models.
- **Observatory Planning Tools:** Leverages M4OPT to calculate telescope Field of Regard (FoR), optimal exposure times, and the most promising sky regions for follow-up.
- **Automation:** Streamlines the workflow for event processing, data filtering, statistical analysis, and visualization, making it accessible for classroom or workshop use.
- **Impact Analysis:** Enables users to compare the performance of different observatories, assess the effect of scheduling strategies, and visualize outcomes.

EarthOrbitPlan demonstrates how to use [M<sup>4</sup>OPT](https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt) to determine the optimal sky regions accessible to each telescope (Field of Regard, FoR), calculate the required exposure time to achieve a target signal-to-noise ratio, and identify the most probable sky coordinates for efficient follow-up observations.


## Who is it for?

- **Students** who want to explore multi-messenger astrophysics through practical examples.
- **Educators** seeking ready-to-use tools and resources for teaching astronomy, physics, or data science.
- **Researchers** wishing to prototype observation strategies or demonstrate multi-messenger concepts.

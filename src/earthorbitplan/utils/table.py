"""Helpers for reading the post-processed event tables."""


def get_skygrid(table):
    """Return the sky grid name of an event table, or "" if it has none.

    Missions with several survey grids (ULTRASAT: "allsky", "non-overlap")
    write the grid name into every row. Missions with a single pointing
    strategy (UVEX) have no grid to name, and postprocess writes a column of
    Python ``None`` there -- an object column that ``numpy.unique`` cannot
    sort, since ``None < None`` is a ``TypeError``. Some older tables instead
    hold the literal string ``"None"``. Both spell "no grid", and both are
    normalised to ``""`` here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : astropy.table.Table
        Event table carrying a ``"skygrid"`` column.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The grid name, or ``""`` when the mission has no grid variants.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the table mixes several grids, which would make a single caption
        or file name wrong for part of the rows.
